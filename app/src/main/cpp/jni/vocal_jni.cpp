// Unlike the mel front end this one is stereo and linear-frequency, because
// that is what open-unmix was trained on. The layout it produces is bin-major
// rather than frame-major specifically so it matches the model's tensor shape
// [1, 2, bins, frames] with no transpose on the Kotlin side.
