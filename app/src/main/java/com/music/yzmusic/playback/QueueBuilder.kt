/**
 * Builds the station that plays on after a one-off song.
 *
 * Two problems this exists to solve:
 *
 *  - YouTube's watch queues routinely carry the same recording twice — the
 *    official audio and the music video are separate videoIds with near
 *    identical titles — so de-duping on id alone lets a track play, then play
 *    again as its video. Songs are matched on a normalised title plus lead
 *    artist instead.
 *
 *  - A radio mix leans hard on the seed's own artist. Capping how many tracks
 *    any one artist contributes keeps a station from turning into a single
 *    artist's discography.
