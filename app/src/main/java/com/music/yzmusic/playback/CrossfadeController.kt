/**
 * A real crossfade: two tracks audible at once, the outgoing one falling as the
 * incoming one rises, the way Spotify and Apple Music do it.
 *
 * ## Why there are two players
 *
 * One ExoPlayer renders one queue item at a time, so at a track boundary there
 * is exactly one source and the gain it can be given is either 1 (no fade) or 0
 * (silence). The previous version of this class was a single-player volume
 * ramp, and that is precisely why it never sounded like a crossfade: it dipped
 * to silence at the join and climbed back out, leaving a hole where the blend
 * should be. Overlap needs a second decoder. There is no way around it.
 *
 * ## Which player plays what
 *
 * Two peers, not a player and a helper. Both are full ExoPlayers built the same
 * way and both can own the queue; at any instant one of them *is* the session
 * (it backs the MediaSession, holds audio focus and carries the notification)
 * and the other is idle. They swap roles at every transition.
 *
 *  - **[active]** — whichever player the session currently points at. The rest
 *    of the app only ever sees this one.
 *  - **[standby]** — the idle player. Between transitions it holds nothing. To
 *    arm a transition it is loaded with *the queue, positioned on the incoming
 *    track* at the plan's cue point, and started silently.
 *
 * The crucial word is **incoming**. An earlier version of this class put the
 * *outgoing* track on the second player: the session player jumped ahead to the
 * next song and the second player carried the old song's tail. That works, but
 * it forces a moment where both players render *the same audio*, and two
 * ExoPlayers cannot be started sample-accurately against each other. Whatever
 * they were misaligned by — measured on real transitions at 9 to 41ms — was
 * heard as the last instant of the outgoing track playing twice, at the head of
 * every single crossfade. No amount of tuning removes that; the duplication is
 * structural.
 *
 * Loading the *incoming* track on the standby removes it outright. The two
 * players never hold the same audio, so there is nothing to align, nothing to
 * hand over, and no seam to hide. The incoming track is simply already playing,
 * from exactly the right position, when its fader starts to move.
 *
 * ## The handoff
 *
 * Because both players own the queue, finishing a transition is a **role swap**
 * rather than a seek: nothing is re-buffered, nothing is re-sought, and no audio
 * is rendered twice. [onHandoff] is what performs it — the service moves the
 * MediaSession, audio focus, its listeners and its bookkeeping onto the incoming
 * player.
 *
 * It fires as the incoming track's first note sounds, not at the end of the
 * blend, which keeps the behaviour the old design was built around: the queue
 * index, the metadata, the notification and the UI all flip to the incoming song
 * the moment it becomes audible, rather than trailing the song on its way out.
 * From that instant [outgoing] is the idle player, still audible, being faded
 * out — which is exactly what the previous design used its tail player for, at
 * none of the cost.
 *
 * ## Curve
 *
 * `sin`/`cos` rather than the old `sqrt`: `sin²+cos²=1` exactly, so two tracks
 * fading past each other hold constant *power* the whole way through and the
 * transition has no dip in the middle. That is the standard crossfade law, and
 * it is what makes a long crossfade sound like a blend instead of a dip.
