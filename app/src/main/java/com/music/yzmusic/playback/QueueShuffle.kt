/**
 * Shuffle as an edit to the queue, not a playback mode.
 *
 * ExoPlayer's own `shuffleModeEnabled` leaves the queue exactly as it is and
 * draws the next track from a hidden random order, so the queue panel shows
 * one running order while the player follows another — the user sees the album
 * listed in order and hears it jumping about. Toggling shuffle here rearranges
 * the queue itself and leaves playback strictly sequential: what the queue
 * shows is what plays, in that order.
 *
 * The order the queue was in beforehand is kept so the toggle can be undone.
 * The player's own shuffle mode is deliberately never enabled — it would
 * randomise on top of the order set here.
 *
 * AutoPlay's tracks are shuffled among themselves and stay below the ones the
 * user queued, which is where the player's AutoPlay section shows them: a
 * shuffle is not a reason for a mix to start cutting in front of the album.
