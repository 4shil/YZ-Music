/**
 * Sleep timer. Holds a deadline; [PlaybackService] watches it and pauses
 * playback once it passes.
 *
 * A deadline rather than a countdown: nothing has to tick for the timer to
 * stay accurate, so it survives the player UI being dismissed, and any
 * observer can work out how long is left for itself. elapsedRealtime, not
 * wall clock, so changing the system time can't cut a timer short.
