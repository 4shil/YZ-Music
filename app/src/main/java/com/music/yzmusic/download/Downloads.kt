/**
 * The download queue, and the record of what came out of it.
 *
 * Split deliberately into two pieces of state that look similar and behave
 * nothing alike:
 *
 *  - [active] is what is happening now — queued, running, just failed. It lives
 *    in memory, is driven by [DownloadService], and is empty on a cold start
 *    because a download interrupted by the process dying did not happen.
 *  - [saved] is what exists on disk, keyed by videoId and remembered across
 *    launches. It is the only way the app can answer "do I already have this?"
 *    without a media-store query per row, and the only way it knows *which*
 *    file a track corresponds to when asked to delete it.
 *
 * [saved] is a claim about a folder this app does not own. The user is expected
 * to manage Downloads with a file manager, so an entry here can outlive the
 * file it names — which is why every read of it goes through [savedUri], and
 * why that verifies before it answers.
