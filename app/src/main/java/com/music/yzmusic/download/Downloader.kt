/**
 * Pulls a resolved stream onto disk.
 *
 * Two things here are not obvious and both are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - **Bounded ranges, not one long GET.** googlevideo paces a continuous
 *    response down to roughly playback speed — about 15kB/s, against 5.7MB/s
 *    for the same bytes asked for as ranges. That is the difference between a
 *    four-minute track saving in a second and saving in four minutes, and it is
 *    the same finding [ChunkedDataSource][com.music.yzmusic.playback.ChunkedDataSource]
 *    exists for.
 *  - **The client's own headers.** googlevideo bakes the identity that minted a
 *    URL into it as `c=`/`cver=` and compares that against the headers of the
 *    request that comes back for the bytes. Fetching with anything else is a
 *    403 — so the fetch is dressed as whatever the URL says made it, which
 *    [PlayerClient.forStreamUrl] can recover from the URL alone.
 *
 * Sequential rather than parallel. Ranges are served at line rate, and a
 * typical AAC track is four megabytes: splitting that across connections buys
 * nothing a user could perceive and costs the temp files and reassembly that a
 * cancelled download would then have to clean up.
 *
 * None of the above is true of a stream from a configured source rather than
 * from YouTube, which is what [fetchDirect] is for.
