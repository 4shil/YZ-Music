/**
 * Turns a queued track into an openable stream, using whichever source can
 * best serve it.
 *
 * Two things happen here that don't happen in any single [MusicSource]:
 *
 *  1. **The quality question is answered once**, from the connection in hand
 *     and the user's ceiling for it — see [requestForNow], or
 *     [requestForDownload] for the one caller whose answer becomes a file
 *     rather than a stream. Sources are told what to serve; they don't each
 *     re-derive it.
 *
 *  2. **The order is applied.** A track is pinned to the source that produced
 *     it, but a pin is a starting point, not a cage: with lossless on, a
 *     higher-priority source that can serve the same recording bit-exact gets
 *     asked first, and a source that fails gets stepped over rather than
 *     failing the track.
 *
 * Whether another source *has* the same recording is [TrackMatcher]'s question,
 * not this one's. Everything here does with a candidate list is ask that, and
 * everything a source is asked for comes from the same place — so the library,
 * a playlist, radio, search and the home feed all substitute on identical
 * terms, whichever of them a track was queued from.

     * one already half-filled — which is the exact corruption
     * [StreamChoice] exists to prevent, arrived at from a new direction.

     * Returning null is not a failure and needs no handling beyond falling back
     * to YouTube, which is what the caller would have done anyway: nothing has
     * been pinned, so the ordinary resolve at playback time is untouched.

     *
     * The same search as [substituteForYouTube] with two differences, both of
     * which are only affordable because sound is already coming out:
     *
     *  - Every module *within* a source is waited for, including the one the
     *    live path gave up on to get playback started (`waitForAll`). That
     *    module is frequently the point: dropping it is what left the listener
     *    on a stream from whoever happened to be quick.
     *  - A result that isn't lossless is still worth having when it is
     *    audibly better than what is playing — see [worthSwapping]. Refusing
     *    those outright is what left a track on YouTube's 160kbps Opus while
     *    a 320kbps AAC from a module sat in hand, unused, because it wasn't
     *    the FLAC that had been asked for.
     *  - Every source is asked, not only the ones that can serve lossless. That
     *    follows from the bullet above: once a lossy stream can win, a lossy
     *    *source* has to be allowed to offer one.
     *
     * Where it matches [substituteForYouTube] exactly is in taking the first
     * answer that clears the bar rather than the best of all of them — see
     * [bestAcross]. The bar here is [worthSwapping] rather than "satisfies the
     * request", and it is a high one: anything clearing it is lossless, or a
     * gain of [UPGRADE_MIN_GAIN_KBPS] over what the listener is hearing. Holding
     * such a stream back to see whether a slower source can do better trades a
     * certain improvement now for a possible improvement later, and "later" here
     * was measured at thirteen seconds.
     *
     * The cost of that choice is real and worth naming: a slow source holding a
     * FLAC can lose to a fast one holding a 320kbps AAC, and the track then
     * plays lossy for the rest of its length, because [QualityUpgrade][com.music.yzmusic.playback.QualityUpgrade]
     * marks a track asked once the answer is yes. It is the same trade the live
     * path makes, made for the same reason.
     *
     * [target] must carry the runtime of the track *actually playing* — see
     * [matchAndStream]'s use of it. Swapping the audio under a listener is
     * only defensible when the replacement is the same recording, and length
     * is the check that a title cannot fake.
     *
     * @param playing what the listener is hearing now, so a lossy candidate
     *   can be judged against it rather than against the request. Null means
     *   unknown, and an unknown floor is treated as one nothing lossy clears:
     *   a swap that might be a downgrade is worse than no swap at all.
