/**
 * Turns a videoId into a URL ExoPlayer can actually stream.
 *
 * Three things make or break this, and the order they are attempted in matters
 * as much as the mechanics of each:
 *
 *  1. **Which endpoint asks.** The `youtubei/v1/player` POST is one small JSON
 *     round trip. The watch page — what a full extractor scrape fetches — is
 *     several hundred kilobytes of HTML and is rate-shaped: under load Google
 *     answers its headers immediately and then feeds the body out over tens of
 *     seconds, or simply stops sending and never closes. That shaping is
 *     invisible as an error and reads to a listener as endless buffering, so
 *     the scrape is kept off the hot path entirely — see [newPipeUrl], the
 *     failsafe of last resort.
 *
 *  2. **Which client asks.** Google turns identities away without notice and
 *     without pattern: the client that works today answers `LOGIN_REQUIRED`
 *     next month. So [CLIENTS] is walked rather than trusted, the one that last
 *     worked is tried first, and one that is refused for a track is stood down
 *     for that track for a while.
 *
 *  3. **Whether the URL is real.** Every googlevideo URL carries an `n`
 *     parameter which, sent as-is, gets the response throttled to a crawl or
 *     refused with 403; it has to be transformed by running YouTube's own
 *     player JavaScript, which is what NewPipe's [YoutubeJavaScriptPlayerManager]
 *     does. That can fail quietly, and a URL can be dead on arrival for reasons
 *     no amount of care predicts — so nothing is handed to the player, or
 *     cached, until a single byte has been fetched from it. See [probe].

     * Player clients in the order they are worth asking, cheapest and most

     * answers, not from what ought to work.
     *
     * The four at the top return plain `url` fields, so a stream is one POST
     * away with no player JavaScript involved at all. [PlayerClient.ANDROID]
     * below them hands back ciphered formats, costing a download of that
     * JavaScript and a signature to solve. See each entry in [PlayerClient].
     *
     * No web client appears here. `WEB_REMIX` was the tail of this list and
     * paid for itself in neither reliability nor speed — always ciphered,
     * usually refused, and reached only on tracks that were already failing,
     * where the one thing left worth spending is time. [newPipeUrl] is the
     * last resort instead.
     *
     * The gating that decides which of these answers is applied per network,
     * not globally — an identity refused on one connection is served on
     * another — which is the whole reason this is a list and why the order is
     * only a starting guess that [clientOrder] corrects from experience.
     *
     * TVHTML5 (Cobalt v7) is first because it works on flagged IPs without
     * PO Token — the most reliable client as of July 2026.
