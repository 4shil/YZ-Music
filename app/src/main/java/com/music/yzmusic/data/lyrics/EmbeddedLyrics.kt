/**
 * The lyrics already sitting inside a downloaded file.
 *
 * The read side of what the download path wrote — see `MediaTagger`, and the
 * three taggers under it. A track that was downloaded had its lyrics fetched
 * once, at download time, and written into the file; asking four servers for
 * them again every time it is played is a network round trip to arrive at a
 * string that is already on disk, and it is the reason a downloaded song showed
 * nothing at all with the connection off.
 *
 * Two fields are read, in this order:
 *
 *  - `YZMUSIC_LYRICS`, this app's own, holding the "enhanced" A2 form with the
 *    word timings intact — see [toEnhancedLrc].
 *  - the container's standard lyrics field, holding plain `[mm:ss.xx]` LRC.
 *
 * The second is what every other player reads and what older downloads have,
 * so it is the fallback rather than the exception. Preferring the first is what
 * keeps a downloaded song lighting up word by word instead of a line at a time.
 *
 * Never throws. A file that isn't one of the three containers, or is one and
 * has no lyrics in it, is a null — the caller falls back to the network, which
 * is exactly what it did before this existed.
