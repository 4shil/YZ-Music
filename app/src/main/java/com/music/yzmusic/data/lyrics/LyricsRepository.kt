/**
 * Where the player gets its lyrics.
 *
 * Eight sources, tried in [order] — the user's own priority list in Settings,
 * defaulting to [LyricsSource.entries]:
 *
 *  - [BetterLyrics] and [PaxSenix] — Apple Music TTML, per-syllable, from two
 *    independent hosts so one having a bad day doesn't cost the timing.
 *  - [LyricsPlus] — the YouLy+ backend; finest timing of the lot, flakiest hosting.
 *  - [SimpMusicLyrics] — keyed on the video id, so it can't fetch the wrong edit.
 *  - [LrcLib], [Musixmatch], [KuGou] — line-synced only, but between them
 *    almost always up, and [KuGou] carries a lot that the others don't.
 *
 * Every enabled source is asked *at the same time*, but their answers are
 * taken in [order]: the loop awaits them one at a time in that sequence, so a
 * lower-priority source finishing first never preempts one still pending
 * ahead of it. Asked one after another instead, a miss on each source would
 * cost its own round trip before the next was even tried, and a track with no
 * lyrics anywhere would spend the best part of a minute finding that out with
 * eight of them. Run together, a miss costs whatever the slowest one needed
 * to still be waited on took.
 *
 * A word-timed answer wins outright. Failing that, a line-timed one is taken
 * from the highest-priority source that had it — better a whole line lighting
 * up in sync than the right animation on lyrics that don't exist.

     * as switching the feature off. [order] is tried first-to-last; a source
     * missing from it (an upgrade that added one after the order was last
     * saved) falls in after everything named, in [LyricsSource]'s own order.
