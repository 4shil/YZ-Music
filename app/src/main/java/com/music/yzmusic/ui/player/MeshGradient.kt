 * [trackKey] changing — and then come to rest. They used to orbit forever,
 * which meant re-blurring a full-screen layer at display refresh rate for as
 * long as the player was up: the most expensive thing in the app, for motion
 * that reads as ambient at best and is invisible while the phone is in a
 * pocket. The settled frame looks the same; only the battery drain is gone.
