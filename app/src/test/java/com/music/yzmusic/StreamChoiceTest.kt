/**
 * The promise [StreamChoice] makes: a track being served from one copy keeps
 * being served from that copy.
 *
 * Every live entry stands behind a half-filled cache entry on disk, and the
 * cost of breaking one is not a wrong bitrate but a corrupt file — the middle
 * of an MP4 appended to a WebM. So the tests here are about what happens under
 * pressure, which is where that promise was breakable.

     * tracks being remembered in between. The most recent entries must still be
     * honoured after the map has been pushed well past its limit.
