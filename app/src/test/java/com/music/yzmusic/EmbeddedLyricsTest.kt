/**
 * The reader and the three taggers have to agree, and nothing else checks that
 * they do: a download writes the file on a device and the player reads it back
 * on another run, so a disagreement between the two shows up as a downloaded
 * song that silently has no lyrics — which is exactly the bug this pair was
 * written for.
 *
 * Each test writes with the real tagger and reads with the real reader, so a
 * change to either side that breaks the pairing fails here rather than on a
 * phone. Placeholder text throughout; no real lyric appears in this file.
